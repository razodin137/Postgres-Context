# Why Neon?

Neon is an incredible tool for managing Postgres.

It's preferable over Backend as a Service (BaaS) tools like Supabase, because of its simplicity.

Both in UI and pricing, it's just databases.

You're paying for storage and compute. 

You can use it for any kind of application.

It's got the nice clean simplicity of Pocketbase,
but with the power of managed hosting and being able to spin up as many databases as you want.

You can have a database per client if you like (recommended only for BIG clients that are willing to pay for the extra security).

Everyone else can get row-level security in the main DB.

That's the power of Postgres.
